# Article-Preview-Component
Frontend Mentor Challenge #01 - A simple article preview component

In this challenge, I have decided to use Bootstrap to help build the card and then
complement it with HTML and CSS. It does prove to be difficult at first only because CSS is 
not my strongest suite. 

I hope to redo this project again with only the help of CSS and HTML and avoid using 
Bootstrap whenever possible. 

This project does not implement Javascript.
